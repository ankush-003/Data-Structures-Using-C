# Data-Structures-Using-C
Learning Data Structures using C Language
This repository includes the following Modules:
Unit-1 : Recursion , Static and Dynamic Memory Allocation

Linked List:  Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List – Single and Double

Unit-2: Stacks and Queues

Stacks: Basic structure of a Stack, Implementation of a Stack using Arrays & Linked list. Applications of Stack: Function execution, Nested functions, Recursion: Tower of Hanoi. Conversion & Evaluation of an expression: Infix to postfix, Infix to prefix, Evaluation of an     Expression, Matching of Parenthesis. Queues & DEQUE: Basic Structure of a Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, DEQUE and its implementation using Arrays and Linked List. Applications of Queue:  Case Study – Josephus problem, CPU scheduling- Implementation using queue (simple /circular).

Unit-3: Trees and Heaps

General: N-ary trees, Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees and Forest: definition, properties, conversion of an N-ary tree and a Forest to a binary tree.  Implementation of BST using  arrays and dynamic allocation : Insertion and deletion operations, Traversal of trees: Preorder, Inorder and Postorder. Implementation of binary expression tree, Threaded binary search tree and its implementation. Heap: Implementation using arrays. Implementation of Priority Queue using heap - min and max heap. Applications of Trees and Heaps: Implementation of a dictionary / decision tree (Words with their meanings).
