STACK ADT:
-> Last in First Out Data structure
-> Operations:
    Push: Place an element in stack (on top of existing if any)
    Pop: Remove last inserted element from stack
    Peep: Look at last inserted element
    Init: Initialise stack
    Display: Display stack contents
-> We use top variable(in case of array impl, -1 in beginning)  
-> Linked list then no need of top (insertfront and deletefront)
-> Top points to the last element inserted to the stack
-> isEmptyStack, isFullStack (in case of array implementation)
-> stack overflow: stack is full and we are trying to Push
-> stack underflow: stack is empty and we are trying to pop (top is -1, head null)

APPLICATIONS:
-> Function Call
-> Recursion
-> Parenthesis Match
-> Infix to Postfix Expression
